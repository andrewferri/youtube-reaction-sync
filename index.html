                    <strong>Q. What happens with my copy of the video? Is it uploaded to some server?</strong>
                    <br/>A. Your video is not uploaded anywhere. It is streamed directly from your computer to the web page in your browser. If you're familiar with JavaScript, feel free to take a look at the source and confirm. If you're not, grab a buddy who is and get them to have a look.

                    <strong>Q. I'm not convinced, is there some other way to verify?</strong>
                    <br/>A. There sure is! Go to the <a href="https://github.com/andrewferri/youtube-reaction-sync">GitHub repository</a> and download the source. Then run the index.html file locally or on your own web server.
