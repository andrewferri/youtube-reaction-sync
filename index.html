            <p>This web app allows you to easily sync a Youtube full reaction with the original video. All you need to supply are the link to the Youtube video, and your own copy of the video.</p>
            <h4>FAQ</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Q. What happens with my copy of the video? Is it uploaded to some server?</strong>
                    <br/>A. Your video is not uploaded anywhere. It is streamed directly from your computer to the web page in your browser.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Q. It's saying my video file is an invalid video format, but it plays fine in my media application?</strong>
                    <br/>A. Different browsers support different video formats. For example, Firefox doesn't currently support .mkv, whereas Chrome does. You will need to convert your video format, or try a different browser.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Q. Will you support anything other than Youtube, such as Patreon?</strong>
                    <br/>A. No. This service is provided as-is. If your reaction channel doesn't provide full reactions on Youtube, then you will have to go back to your previous method of syncing videos.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Q. How do I suggest a feature?</strong>
                    <br/>A. This service is provided as-is. No requests will be taken at this time.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Disclaimer: this service is not affiliated with any Youtube reaction channels.</p>
