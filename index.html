            <p>This web app allows you to easily sync a Youtube full reaction with the original video. All you need to supply are the link to the Youtube video, and your own copy of the video.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Q. What happens with my copy of the video? Is it uploaded to some server?</strong>
                    <br/>A. Your video is not uploaded anywhere. It is streamed directly from your computer to the web page in your browser. If you're familiar with JavaScript, feel free to take a look at the source and confirm. If you're not, grab a buddy who is and get them to have a look.
                </li>

                    <strong>Q. It's saying my video file is an invalid video format, but it plays fine in my media application?</strong>
                    <br/>A. Different browsers support different video formats. For example, Firefox doesn't currently support .mkv, whereas Chrome does. You will need to convert your video format, or try a different browser.
