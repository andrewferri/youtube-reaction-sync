            <p>This web app allows you to easily sync a Youtube full reaction with the original video. All you need to supply are the link to the Youtube video, and your own copy of the video.</p>
            <h4>FAQ</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Q. What happens with my copy of the video? Is it uploaded to some server?</strong>
                    <br/>A. Your video is not uploaded anywhere. It is streamed directly from your computer to the web page in your browser. You can tell because the video loads instantly, whereas if it were uploading to a server, it would take several minutes to load. If you're familiar with JavaScript, feel free to take a look at the source and confirm. If you're not, grab a buddy who is and get them to have a look.

                    <strong>Q. It's saying my video file is an invalid video format, but it plays fine in my media application?</strong>
                    <br/>A. Different browsers support different video formats. For example, Firefox doesn't currently support .mkv, whereas Chrome does. You will need to convert your video format, or try a different browser.
